# Dyslexia Helper App

An app which can change entered text into text which is more readily readible for dyslexics. Problem characters are given their own color.
I started developing the app after a suggestion from my wife. While practicing reading with our daughter, she highlighted certain characters in the text with colors. This greatly seemed to help our daughter with her ability to differentiate characters, a known problem for dyslexics.

## Functionality

To use the app, first clone repo then run the following:

```
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

After completion open the index.html in the dist folder.

## Completion

The app is still in alpha phase
